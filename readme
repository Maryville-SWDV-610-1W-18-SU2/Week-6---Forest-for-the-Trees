trees.py - Generate a random list of integers. It show the binary heap tree resulting from inserting the integers on the list one at a time.
Using the list from the previous question, show the binary heap tree resulting from the list as a parameter to the buildHeap method.  
Show both the tree and list form.
buildParseTreeNoSpaces.py	- Extend the buildParseTree function to handle mathematical expressions that do not have spaces between every character.
